## Work division

We as a team have outlined tasks for our Workshop, and came down to the following:

- 3 problems that our solution would solve
- Ways our solution would remedy the stated problems (1 for each problem)
- 5 Technologies required by a solution

Given that the person who stated the problem would have the most understanding of how to solve it, we have unified stating the problem and proposing the solution to it in one task.

Overall, we have 8 tasks (3 problems/solutions and 5 technologies) that are divided evenly within 4 members of out team.
